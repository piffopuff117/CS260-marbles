# CS260-marbles
## CS260, Assignment 1

In this assignment I get to simulate a bag of marbles. There will be attributes about each marble E.g. size, color, in-bag. 

The user will be able to take marbles out of the bag and put marbles back in.

I think the best way to go about programming this would be to use a struct/class and have each instance of the class represent a marble. The class will contain key information about the marble E.g. size, color, in-bag. When a user pulls a marble out of the bag that information will be listed to them and they will be able to pull out more marbles or put the marbles they've pulled out back in. The in-bag variable will be updated accordingly.
